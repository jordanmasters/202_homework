# John Von Neumann (1903-1957)

## Early History

* Hungarian
* 1929 Hungary --> America
* Lutheran School - Mostly Jews
	* The Martians 
		* Theodore Von Karman 	
			* Mathematician, aerospace engineer, and physicist
		* George de Hevesy 		
			* Radiochemist and Nobel laureate
		* Leo Szilard			
			* Physicist and inventor. 
			* He conceived the nuclear chain reaction in 1933, 
			* Patented the idea of a nuclear reactor with Enrico Fermi, and in late 1939
			* Wrote the letter for Albert Einstein's signature that resulted in the Manhattan	
		* Eugene Wigner	
			* Theoretical physicist, engineer and mathematician. 
			* He received half of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963 "for his contributions to the theory of the atomic nucleus and the elementary particles
		* Edward Teller	
			* Theoretical physicist, nuclear and molecular physics
			* Father of hydrogen bomb
		* Paul Erdos
			* Prolific mathematician
			* More than 500 collaborators
		* These other 'geniuses' said Neumann was the only true genius they ever met
## Major Contributions:
* application of operator theory to quantum mechanics, 
* development of functional analysis
* concept of cellular automata
* His analysis of the structure of self-replication preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA.
* Manhattan project 
	* math model of explosive lenses
	* Nuclear physics
* Game theory
* Set Theory
* Ergodic Theory
	* branch of mathematics that studies dynamical systems with an invariant measure
	* A central concern of ergodic theory is the behavior of a dynamical system when it is allowed to run for a long time
		* The first result in this direction claims that almost all points in any subset of the phase space eventually revisit the set
		* statistically speaking, the system that evolves for a long time "forgets" its initial state. 
* Lattice Theory
* Fluid Dynamics (numerical hydrodynamics)
	* artificial viscosity that improved the understanding of shock waves
