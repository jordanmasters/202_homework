# John Von Neumann (1903-1957)

## Personal Background

* Hungarian Secular Jew
* Child Prodigy, Other 'geniuses' said Neumann was the only true genius they ever met
* 1929 Hungary --> America

## Major Contributions:
* application of operator theory to quantum mechanics, 
* development of functional analysis
* concept of cellular automata
* His analysis of the structure of self-replication preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA.
* Manhattan project 
	* math model of explosive lenses
	* Nuclear physics


* Game theory
* Set Theory
* Ergodic Theory
	* branch of mathematics that studies dynamical systems with an invariant measure
	* A central concern of ergodic theory is the behavior of a dynamical system when it is allowed to run for a long time
		* The first result in this direction claims that almost all points in any subset of the phase space eventually revisit the set
		* statistically speaking, the system that evolves for a long time "forgets" its initial state. 
* Lattice Theory
* Fluid Dynamics (numerical hydrodynamics)
	* artificial viscosity that improved the understanding of shock waves
