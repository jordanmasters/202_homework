# Python Basics

## Scrapy Demo - Getting the Data
1) make a new project directory somewhere
```shell
mkdir PythonBasicsTut1 && cd $_
```

2) Clone a simple quotes bot repo provided by scrapy
```shell
git clone https://github.com/scrapy/quotesbot.git quotesbot
cd quotesbot
mkdir scrapedData
```
3) Let's start using Scrapy! Make sure you have it installed
```shell
scrapy
# if it is not a command then do:
pip install scrapy
```
4) Check the spiders we have available
```shell
scrapy list
```
6) Use one of the spider classes to pull and save data as .json or .csv
```shell
scrapy crawl toscrape-css -o scrapedData/quotes.json
```
7) Let's do it again and make 3 csv files we can work with later 
* yes, they will all have the same exact data, but importantly, they will also all have the same data structure
```shell
scrapy crawl toscrape-css -o scrapedData/quotes1.csv
scrapy crawl toscrape-css -o scrapedData/quotes2.csv
scrapy crawl toscrape-css -o scrapedData/quotes3.csv
```


## Simple Python Execution Workflows - Merging CSV files

### First let's merge these files in the command line

```shell
cat *.csv > merged.csv
```
#### Pros
* fast, short code

#### Cons
* not easy to customize
* we had headers in each of the files, and each of those headers in now in the merged file

#### Can the 'tail' command get us closer?
```shell
tail -n +2 *.csv > merged.csv
```

### Python Workflow 1 - Interpreter to write and execute code
#### Tools: command line, python interpreter 
#### Code: no files, all in live interpreter

1. start interpreter
```shell
python
```
2. write code in interpreter
```python
import os
import csv


def merge_csvs_into_list(directory):
	"""	
	:param directory: the directory with csv files
	:returns: return list of lists of merged csv contnt  
	"""
	merged_csv_list = []
	csv_count = 0
	header = []
	for filename in os.listdir(directory):
		if filename.endswith(".csv"): 
			csv_count += 1
			print 'opening', os.path.join(directory, filename)
			f = open(os.path.join(directory, filename), 'rU')
			# simplify to basic list functions like readlines and split
			csv_f = csv.reader(f)
			csv_list = list(csv_f)
			header = csv_list.pop(0)
			for line in csv_list:
				merged_csv_list.append(line)
		else:
			continue
	print 'merged', csv_count, 'csv files into a python list'
	print 'merged list has', len(merged_csv_list), 'rows'
	return merged_csv_list, header

def write_csv_from_list(new_file_path, cvs_list, header):
	"""	
	:param new_file_path: the directory with csv files
	:param cvs_list: list of lists
	:param header: list of header strings
	:returns: return list of lists of merged csv contnt  
	"""
	with open(new_file_path, "w") as output:
		writer = csv.writer(output, lineterminator='\n')
		cvs_list.insert(0, header)
		writer.writerows(cvs_list)


```
#### Usage:	python interpreter	 	
1. call functions from same interpreter session only
```python
merged_csv_list, header = merge_csvs_into_list('quotesbot')
```
```python
write_csv_from_list('python_merged_quotes.csv', merged_csv_list, header)
```

#### Pros:								
1. check simple code (one liners), often w/ toy data 
2. check your intuitions about data manipulation
	1. ex: what does `myString[:-1]` give me when `myString = 'Hello'`?

#### Cons:								
1. not reusable or saved
2. no editor
3. inefficient when writing more than a few lines of code

### Python Workflow 2 - Interpreter to import code from custom modules and execute code
#### Tools: command line, python interpreter, text editor
#### Code: 1 module (file)
* Instead of writing our functions in the temporary memory of the interpreter, we can write them in a .py file somewhere

#### Usage: python interpreter				
1. move to into myfile.py file dir
	* `$ cd`
2. start interpreter
	* `$ python`
3. load module into current terminal session
	* `>>> import myfile`
4. call function from module
	* `>>> myfile.myFunction()`


#### Pros:					
1. Using the python interpreter to call functions can be useful if you are working with functions that output something, and you want to have a simple interactive environment to try various inputs and see their outputs, e.g. search engines, chatbots, question asking systems, etc.
2. interactive way to import various modules or packages and play with them live in the interpreter.

#### Cons:					
1. usage commands are not saved, often we want to save the function calls somewhere

### Python Workflow 3 - Command line to run custom modules w/ non-modular code
#### Tools: terminal + editor: 
#### Code: 1 file: function, followed by function call in .py script
#### Usage: 				
1. move to into myfile.py file dir
	* `$ cd`
2. Run file from command line
	* `$ python myfile.py`

#### Pros:					
1. will both load your function and execute it (will execute everything in the .py synchronously)

#### Cons:
1. not resuable, except in this exact use case, 
2. bad coding practice
	* This is because the function is tied to the function call, they should be separate, in different files.
	* Also, from a git perspective, you should not need to edit the file that contains the function if all you are doing is changing how you are calling the function i.e. what arguments you pass it in some specific instance

### Python Workflow 4 - Command line to run code from script file w/ modular code
#### terminal + editor  
#### Code: 2 files:			
1. 1 file with functions only
2. 1 file as a 'script' file to do imports and call functions 
			* a script file is a file containing mostly commands like you would enter in the command line or in an interpreter. it allows you to chain dependencies and function calls together in a modular and resuable fashion, keeping your functions separate.

#### Usage: 				
1. move to into myfile.py file dir
	* `$ cd`
2. Run file from command line
	* `$ python myfile.py`

#### Pros:					
1. Modular, Resuable 
2. often we want to call more a set of command in some specific order, and save it for later
3. DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself 

#### Cons:					
	* little bit more organization upfront












							   python -> import -> call function from python interpreter



			terminal 1 file -> python filename.py

			terminal -> python -> call function





tools:
	Python Notebook
	spyder
	terminal
	qt console




Coding:
	python packages vs libraries
